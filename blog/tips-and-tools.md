title: 5 organisational tips & tools as a knowledge transfer polyglot

I'll start by addressing the obvious question: what's a knowledge transfer polyglot?

Essentially, I wear several hats (aka, do several different jobs) all based around transferring knowledge to someone else. These range from a technical author, to academic researcher, to university lecturer, and private tutor.

Over the past few years of moving between these roles, I have developed a few techniques, and found a few tools, to help keep myself organised, focussed, and efficient.

In this post, I'm going to take you through my top five tools and techniques.

## 1.) Plain text > rich text

In all of my jobs, I have to write a lot, and what I write ranges from scribbled notes in meetings, to lesson plans, to project overviews.

There are two things that I have found come up time and again when writing: I don't want to deal with an odd formatting error when I'm just trying to jot something down, and I need things to be consistent.

Both of these requirements have resulted in me only using a plain text editor for the vast majority of my note taking and lesson planning over the past few years.

My text editor of choice is [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/): it's easy to set up and the solarisation option definitely helps after hours of staring at the screen. It also has a great OrgMode package (which I'll get onto shortly!).

As a side note, I also have established a naming convention that helps me organise all of these varying documents and makes them searchable. In order to be able to cross reference with my calendar/agenda and easy to sort, I lead with the date (in ISO 8601 format) and then use kebab case to name the document, for example: 2022-05-03-tools-techniques-blogpost.

## 2.) OrgMode (for Sublime)

I am relatively new to OrgMode, and only started really using it at the start of 2022, but I have used it every day since. Firstly, a caveat: I use an OrgMode package for Sublime called [Org Extended](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/OrgExtended), rather than directly using Emacs. This was partially to keep all of my work centrally located, but also I only use it currently in a very specific (and limited way), and Org Extended made setting up this quite simple instance very easy.

I currently use OrgMode as a planning and personal agenda tool. Every morning, I create a ToDo List which then gets pulled into the Agenda so I can see my day mapped out. I particularly rely on the checklist feature which enables me to see how many tasks I have to do that day. I include everything I want to get done in my day, which can range from publishing a blogpost, outlining a new research project, marking student work, or just remembering to do my Duolingo (I can't let the streak die!).

OrgMode is the only way of writing Todo lists that has stuck for me. The way in which it pulls all my information together and can be configured so easily has made it ideal for my varied and changing schedule. It also means I can see exactly how many tasks I have on for each day (I have a limit of 20 - any more and they won't get done), and can easily add, update, or remove tasks.

I have made some configuration changes which have helped me make Org Extended even more useful, and I'm planning on documenting those here shortly!

## 3.) Trello & Pomello

A couple of years into my PhD, my second supervisor told me about [Pomello](https://pomelloapp.com/): a Pomodoro Technique timer that created tasks based off your Trello.

I had used [Trello](https://trello.com/) since an introductory PhD project management seminar, and had used it to organise various aspects of my PhD project (readings, meetings, chapter outlines, etc.). However, I found that all of the time management techniques I had tried (various apps, bigger project overviews like Gantt Charts) hadn't stuck, and it had been difficult to reconcile the various pieces of software I was using.

With Pomello, however, I could just use a Pomodoro timer against already existing tasks, meaning that I didn't need to replicate my work lists, and could also utilise the categories and labels I'd spent so long creating on Trello.

Plus there are some little incentives that I find motivating: you can create a graph or a timeline of your productivity, and it also puts pleasing tomato emojis on your tasks with a number.

## 4.) reMarkable

Like many (most?) millennials, I don't really have enough room in my flat for a printer that I'll use occasionally, only to have to store all the paper afterwards (as well as before).

This was part of the initial reason behind getting the [reMarkable 2 tablet](https://www.remarkable.com/). As an e-paper tablet, it feels remarkably like reading off (and writing on) paper, and allows me 'print' to it, creating PDFs that can then be annotated.

I began using the reMarkable to read articles, but ended up reading my 80,000 word thesis...twice. I have since used it to sign contracts, mark hand-written student work, and just read for leisure. I occasionally use it for note taking which does feel excellent, but I both tend to use Sublime for all of my note taking, and have not excellent (aka, bad) handwriting, making typed notes much more useful in the long run!

As an early adopter of the tablet, I was grandfathered in to the premium cloud subscription service for free, and would absolutely recommend that service for anyone thinking of getting the tablet. It enables me to email work directly from the device, integrate with Google Drive (or Dropbox or OneNote if you use those), and have cloud backup for all of my documents.

## 5.) Scrivener (for when I have to use rich text)

As I said, I much prefer using a plain text editor for the vast majority of my work, but of course sometimes I need to use a rich text editor (for example, when writing my thesis).

In those cases, I like to use [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview). Designed for large manuscripts, Scrivener is a rich text editor and document management system rolled into one. Featuring a separate research area for notes (I have used it to store quotations, images, and plans before), Scrivener makes it easy to break your large projects into manageable chunks to then be compiled together later.

Key features that I have found the most useful are the split screen, enabling you to see (and navigate) two documents at once within the programme, the snapshot and rollback feature (which offers a form of version control), and the word count (per day and per project) targets.
